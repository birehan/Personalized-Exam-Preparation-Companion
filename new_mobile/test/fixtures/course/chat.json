                "A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a conductor through the process of electromagnetic induction. When there is relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor, a voltage is induced across the conductor, causing an electric current to flow. This phenomenon is governed by Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction."
