                    "description": "Which type of bond links the carboxyl group of a fatty acid to the hydroxyl group of a glycerol molecule in a lipid?",
                    "choiceA": "Peptide bond",
                    "choiceB": "Ester bond",
                    "choiceC": "Glycosidic bond",
                    "choiceD": "Phosphate bond",
                    "answer": "choice_B",
                    "explanation": "Ester bonds form when the carboxyl group of a fatty acid reacts with the hydroxyl group of a glycerol molecule in a condensation reaction. This forms a triglyceride, a type of lipid. Peptide bonds are found in proteins, glycosidic bonds in carbohydrates and phosphate bonds in nucleic acids and ATP, thus these are not correct.",
